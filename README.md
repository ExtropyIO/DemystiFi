# DemystiFi MetaMask Plugin

## Proposed functionality includes

-   Plugin alerts when interacting with a suspicious contract
-   We maintain a db of contracts with a score of their 'health'
-   People can report contracts, but they must have evidence (ie a transaction) showing their interaction with the contract
-   We can do some analysis of price movements of tokens against social media mentions for evidence of pump / dump scams
-   Analyse smart contracts for 'rug pulling' or too much developer control
-   Note which contracts haven't been audited
-   Plugin should also be aware of ENS names for the contract
-   Use d3.js for display - e.g. https://observablehq.com/@d3/radial-tidy-tree
-   https://duneanalytics.com/ may also be useful
-   https://etherscan.io/apis#contracts for analysing smart contracts / checking verification status

## Areas to investigate

1. MetaMask plugin development
    1. Visualising data
2. Storing/retrieving data (with Textile/Powergate and Graph)
